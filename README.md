# Liberia Wealth Prediction
As a personal extension of my previously completed extra credit assignment ([located here](https://sasan-faraj.github.io/Extra_Credit)), I aimed to compare a random forest model and a K-nearest neighbors model in their accuracy of predicting the level of wealth of individuals persons in Liberia. My code for this project can be located [here](https://sasan-faraj.github.io/wealth_prediction/wealth_prediction)

## Reason for Project
This is my first project out of many that I aim to conduct outside of an academic setting. My main goal of the project is to reflect on some of my road blocks (ie what didn't go so well) of creating my own data science project without overlying instructions. As I desire to go explore my different area of research interests, I simply modified a past extra credit assignment in order to ease the transition into more realistic analysis.
